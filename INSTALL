# simply run:

qmake-qt4
make

# note: maybe your QT installation only provides
# qmake (not qmake-qt4). That is ok as long as
# qmake -v shows something like:
# "Using Qt version 4.5.x" or higher versions
# in this case run:
# qmake
# make

# to install:
cp colorcode /usr/bin/

# to uninstall:
rm /usr/bin/colorcode
